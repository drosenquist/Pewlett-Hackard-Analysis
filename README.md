# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Background and Purpose
Pewlett Hackard is concerned about the “silver tsunami” as many of its current employees begin to reach retirement age. An analysis was performed to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to help the company develop its succession planning.

* Pewlett Hackard faces a large number of upcoming retirees in senior roles with 25,916 and 24,926 senior enginners and senior staff, respecticaly, retiring soon.
* There are an additional large number of upcoming retirees in Enginner, (general) Staff, Technique Leader, and Assistant Engineer roles.
* There are 1549 employees that are eligable for the company's mentorship program.

## Summary
Pewlett Hackard is facing the upcoming retirement of 72,458 of its empoyees. Replacing that many employees over the next few years is a large task and they will need to development a plan to replace that large number of employees.

The mentorship program doesn't have enough mentors to train and mentor the next generation of employees. There is almost on average 50 employees for each mentor that qualifies to be a mentor. 50 employees per mentor is likely to be uneffective as the mentor wouldn't be able to provide meaningful support to soo many employees at once.

It would be helpful to understand what departments each mentor is in and the number of retirement ready employees by department. The original breakdown of retiring employees was done by title, not department. Running the two queries refecence above would help us to determine that actual mentor to mentoree ratio and which department will need additional support.
